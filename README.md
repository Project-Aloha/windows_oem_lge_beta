# Windows Driver pack for LGE G8s

This repository contains driver binary files for LGE G8s based on MTP855 drivers.
All driver binary files form a board support package to be used on LGE G8s to provide hardware support for the Windows operating system.

These driver files are not perfect, typos may exist, feel free to file an issue on GitHub in case you found any. These driver files are based on @gus33000 's drivers for MTP855. Huge thanks to @gus33000!
